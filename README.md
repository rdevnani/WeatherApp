# What are we Learning

Build a weather app together and broaden our understanding of Swift and iOS frameworks. We will start by learning foundational concepts like networking and concurrency while building on our existing knowledge of data modeling, view models and more. Weâ€™ll even take a look at how we can structure our code better and construct decoupled classes and structs that lead to greater code reuse.
